# Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze the transportation data provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) to uncover insights related to the efficiency, safety, and environmental impacts of freight transportation across various modes (road, rail, air, and water).

# Files
- data_append_freight.py was used to append all of the csv data files together. The script works as to open a GUI where a user selects a number of files which are then stored and appended in an SQLite database.
- handling_data.ipynb removes duplicates from the fully loaded database tables.
- transborder_data_analysis.ipynb contains the complete analysis performed.
- codes-north-american-transborder-freight-raw-data.pdf contains product description of features in the data.
- united-states-map-with-canada-and-mexico.png is an image file that shows the different states or provinces in US, Mexico and Canada.
